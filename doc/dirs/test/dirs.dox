 * @brief This directory contains all test cases for the mpicxx library.
 * @attention Gtest's death tests are only enabled if `-DENABLE_DEATH_TESTS=ON` (default: `OFF`) was set during cmake
 * configuration. The reason is that gtest's `fork()` call inside death tests currently doesn't work with MPI.
